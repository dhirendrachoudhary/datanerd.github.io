# Understanding Transformer Architecture: From Attention to GPT

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the groundbreaking paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, has revolutionized not just natural language processing, but the entire field of machine learning. This architecture has become the foundation for models like BERT, GPT, T5, and countless others that have achieved state-of-the-art results across various tasks.

## The Problem with Sequential Processing

Before Transformers, the dominant architectures for sequence modeling were Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants like LSTMs and GRUs. While these models were effective, they had several limitations:

1. **Sequential Processing**: RNNs process sequences step by step, making parallelization difficult
2. **Long-range Dependencies**: Information from early tokens can get lost in long sequences
3. **Training Speed**: Sequential nature makes training slow on modern hardware

## Enter the Transformer

The Transformer architecture addressed these issues by introducing a novel mechanism called **self-attention** and completely eliminating recurrence and convolution.

### Key Components

#### 1. Self-Attention Mechanism

The core innovation of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import math

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def scaled_dot_product_attention(self, Q, K, V, mask=None):
        # Calculate attention scores
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(self.d_k)
        
        # Apply mask if provided
        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
        
        # Apply softmax
        attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        
        # Apply attention to values
        output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        
        return output, attention_weights
    
    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        
        # Linear transformations and reshape
        Q = self.W_q(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        K = self.W_k(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        V = self.W_v(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        
        # Apply attention
        attention_output, attention_weights = self.scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask)
        
        # Concatenate heads
        attention_output = attention_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(
            batch_size, -1, self.d_model
        )
        
        # Final linear transformation
        output = self.W_o(attention_output)
        
        return output, attention_weights
