# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are computational models inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

### Key Components

1. **Neurons (Nodes)**: The basic processing units
2. **Weights**: Parameters that determine the strength of connections
3. **Biases**: Additional parameters that help the model fit the data
4. **Activation Functions**: Functions that determine the output of neurons

## Basic Architecture

```python
import numpy as np

class SimpleNeuron:
    def __init__(self, weights, bias):
        self.weights = weights
        self.bias = bias
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        return np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.bias
